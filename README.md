This isn't a biome mod, no new tree generation has been implemented. 99% of the content is a resource pack; the only "mod" mechanic is the reimplementation of pink wood. See below.

![8 different colored wood planks](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/e258a156e588e1d7aea04c32de2286822410c547.png)

In order w/changes:
- Bamboo, removed the green hue to match real bamboo plank tones.
- Mangrove, now orange to match real life mangrove. (Yes, mangrove is orange. Only the skin is red).
- Bulnesia, replaces acacia. Mangrove is now orange, changed to avoid repeats.
- Purpleheart, _replaces_ cherry _in the overworld_. See rosewater.
- Crimson, actually red.
- Rosewater, used to be cherry. Obtained by cooling (right-clicking) crimson in water.
- Malachite, replaces warped only in name.
- Azurite, completely new wood set. Obtained by cooling (right-clicking) malachite in water.

While still 100% usable, **this mod is not thought to be backwards compatible with already created worlds**. Purpleheart and bulnesia **WILL** replace your cherry and acacia builds. If this is something you're okay with, you are free to use it on your older worlds, it will otherwise not break anything.
